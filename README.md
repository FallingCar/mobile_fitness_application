# mobile_fitness_application
A mobile application designed to track certain fitness aspects. This application uses Dart and Flutter.
To run the application, start by installing dart and flutter, and once installed, in the project directory, run "flutter pub get" in a terminal which will download the dependencies listed in the pubspec.yaml. Once these are installed, run "flutter run" in a terminal to launch the application. There may be a prompt to select which browser the application will run on, and once selected the application will run. To run this on a mobile phone, the steps may vary based on your device's operating system. For example, on iOS, you will need to download Xcode and geolocator, and also create an Apple developer account. Then the phone will need to be plugged into the Mac computer with Xcode, and the application will be able to be ran, which will download it onto the phone. Once this is done, the phone can be unplugged and can be tested. To rerun the app, the phone will need to be plugged in and ran on Xcode again.
